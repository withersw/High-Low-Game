# Overview

This project uses classes to create a game that allows users to make guesses from a stack of numbered cards and earn points based off whether they guess right or not. When run a number will be displayed representing a card. The user will then have the oppurtunity to guess whether the next card will be higher or lower. If the user guesses right they will be given points and if they guess wrong they will lose points. The user will be given the option to keep platying or to end the game. If the user indicates they want to end the game or the run out of points the game will terminate. 

Here is a video that demonstrates the software running and a walkthrough of the code.
